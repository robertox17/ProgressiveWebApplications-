# ProgressiveWebApplications-
Welcome to the Text Editor! This is a single-page application that functions as a progressive web app (PWA) and features a number of data persistence techniques to ensure that your writing is saved and available even when offline. The app utilizes the idb package, a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API, to store and retrieve data from an IndexedDB database.

## Future Plans
I plan to continue improving and expanding the app, with a focus on functionality and user experience. Some ideas I have for the future include:

Adding more advanced formatting options, such as the ability to create lists, tables, and headings
Implementing a spell checker and grammar checker to help improve the quality of your writing
Adding the ability to save and retrieve your writing from different devices and browsers
